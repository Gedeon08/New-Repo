# Exercise 13: Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
# Task: Create a list of years [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995] and generate a new list with the approximate age of a person born in that year.
# To generate a new list, start with an empty list [], and use append() to add elements to it.
print("Exercise 13:")
years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995]

age = []

for year in years:
    age.append(2024 - year)

print(age)
